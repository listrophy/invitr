<h2>HOLLLARIT!</h2>

<p>My wife Stacy and I were talking about how long it's been since we
just had a bunch of friends over for a cookout. I regret that I'm not
able to continue coworking down at Bendyworks due to childcare changes, etc.,
so we said "Hey, let's notify the crew, get a keg, start a fire,
grill meats and veggies, and listen to Dj Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince
perform <b>Summertime</b> on loop until a neighbor calls the police."</p>
